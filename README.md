# CPP
This is an implementation of Queue class in cpp.
I used this implementation to make a palindrome checker where I applied the basic concepts of OOP(Object Oriented Programing)
Note: palindrome definition is "a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards".
Also I made a phone book program where you can add, search, update, delete a contact and also you can traverse all the phonebook cotacts or destroying the phonebook.
