# CPP
This is an implementation of Queue class in cpp.
I used this implementation to make a palindrome checker where I applied the basic concepts of OOP(Object Oriented Programing)
Note: palindrome definition is "a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards".
And I made a phonebook program where you can search, delete, update or destroy all contacts.
